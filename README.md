#Scheduled tasks (Scheduler Task), as many of us know, is the completion of the work task to be done without any human intervention when the time comes.
Quartz actually does exactly this. It keeps the specified threads in its memory and runs them when the time comes. This time frame allows us to give the time frame we want in the format specified in the cron name.
Firstly, a Job (thread) is defined and then the Trigger (for whom and in which time period) of this thread is set. After these two structures match, they are ready to start running in the Scheduler's context memory.
